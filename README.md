# NYC Yellow Taxi Demand Prediction
My capstone project deals with the New York City’s yellow taxi’s demand prediction based on various demographic features by making use of machine learning and deep learning models and techniques to fulfill the supply and demand problems faced by New York city yellow taxi service providers. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the only New York’s government agency authorized to provide licenses to private cab companies for street-hailing and pre-arranged services. Moreover, companies that are specifically online booking based such as Uber and Lyft are also licensed by New York’s TLC agency, but are not authorized for street-hailing. Loss of business and inconvenience to the people travelling in New York city could be solved by providing real time insights to the drivers. This project makes use of the official data acquired by Taxi and Limousine commission of New York.
